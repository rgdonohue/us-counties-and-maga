2024 Annual Data Release: Analytic Dataset Codebook
The SAS and CSV files provided at https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-healthrankings/rankings-data-documentation contain the measure value, numerator, denominator and
confidence intervals, where available.
There are seven descriptive variables included for each row to identify what geographic area the data
represent and whether the county was included in the Health Groups. These variables are:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

statecode = FIPS State Code
countycode = FIPS County Code
fipscode = 5-digit FIPS Code
state = State abbreviation
county = County or State name
year = Release year
county_clustered equals 1 when the county was included in the Health Groups and equals 0 if the
county has not grouped. This variable is set to missing for state and national data.

Each measure variable name is coded with a measure ID. These measure IDs can be found in the tables
at the end of the documentation. You will find at least five variables for each measure:
Measure value coded as v(measure id)_rawvalue
Numerator coded as v(measure id)_numerator
Denominator coded as v(measure id)_denominator
Lower bound of 95% confidence interval coded as v(measure id)_cilow
Upper bound of 95% confidence interval coded as v(measure id)_cihigh
Non-standard measure variables
Health care provider measures (v004, v088, v062, v131): Four measures have a “ratio” variable
included. These measures and their corresponding variables are:
•
•
•
•

Primary Care Physicians (variable = v004_other_data_1),
Dentists (variable = v088_other_data_1),
Mental Health Providers (variable = v062_other_data_1), and
Other Primary Care Providers (variable = v131_other_data_1)

For these measures, the value reported for each county is a ratio of population:number of providers.
However, in calculating the composite scores used to generate Health Groups, we use the actual rate of
number of providers/100,000 population. The analytic dataset includes both the rate (as the raw value
variable), and the ratio (as the “other data 1” variable).
When a county has no reported providers (ratio = [population]:0), the value for the ratio variable is
assigned to be the negative population value. For example, v004_other_data_1 stores the ratio variable
as a positive number if the ratio is XXXX:1. However, for counties that have zero providers, the value is
stored as a negative number to indicate that the ratio is different and is instead XXXX:0. (For example, if
the ratio is 2000:0, the value stored in the field would be -2000.)

Drinking Water Violations (v124): is an indicator variable, where a 1 indicates a "Yes", while a 0
indicates a "No".
Severe Housing Problems (v136): In addition to the standard variables (e.g., raw value, confidence
intervals), there are three additional variables for this measure:
•
•
•

Percentage of households with high housing costs (variable = v136_other_data_1),
Percentage of households with overcrowding (variable = v136_other_data_2),
Percentage of households with lack of kitchen or plumbing facilities (variable =
v136_other_data_3)

Juvenile Arrests (v158): There are two variables that are summed to create the number of juvenile
arrests:
•
•

Petitioned cases (variable = v158_other_data_1),
Non-petitioned cases (variable = v158_other_data_2)

Race-specific data: Several measures are available by race/ethnicity categories for counties with
sufficient sub-population sizes. These measures are coded as:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

v(measure ID)_race_aian for the American Indian & Alaska Native population estimate
v(measure ID)_race_asian for the Asian population estimate
v(measure ID)_race_black for the Black population estimate
v(measure ID)_race_hispanic for the Hispanic population estimate
v(measure ID)_race_nhopi for the Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander population
estimate
v(measure ID)_race_tom for the two or more races population estimate
v(measure ID)_race_white for the white population estimate

If confidence intervals are available for race-specific data, the variable name is the same as the raw value
variable, except with a “_cilow” or “_cihigh” extension. For example, the confidence intervals for
American Indian & Alaska Native years of potential life lost values are given by v001_race_aian_cilow
and v001_race_aian_cihigh.
