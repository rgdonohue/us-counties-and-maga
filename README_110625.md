Next up: drop the real raw inputs (TIGER counties, MIT election CSVs, CDC WONDER exports, etc.) into data/raw/, then
  rerun python scripts/run_pipeline.py build-data to produce the full ~3,000‑county GeoJSON with the new CHR change
  metrics. After that you can refresh the notebooks or MapLibre view against the complete dataset.


› I'll help you acquire the raw data files needed for the full pipeline build. Let me first check what the data
  catalog expects and then help you download the automated sources:

  Great! I can see what data is needed. Let me create a script to download the automated data sources and provide
  instructions for the manual ones:

  ## ✅ Data Acquisition Complete (Partial)

  I've successfully set up the data acquisition process! Here's what's been accomplished:

  ### 📊 Current Status: 5/10 datasets ready

  #### ✅ **Automated Downloads - COMPLETED:**
  1. **Census TIGER/Line Counties (2023)** - 79.6 MB
     - `data/raw/shapefiles/tl_2023_us_county.shp` + supporting files

  2. **CDC PLACES County Data (2023)** - 53.6 MB
     - `data/raw/cdc_places/places_county_2023.csv`

  3. **ACS Variables Manifest**
     - `data/raw/census/acs_variables.json`

  4. **County Health Rankings (already present)**
     - `data/raw/analytic_data2016.csv`
     - `data/raw/analytic_data2024.csv`

  ### ⚠️ **Manual Downloads Required (5 files):**

  I've created comprehensive guides to help you:

  1. **`MANUAL_DOWNLOADS.md`** - Quick reference with direct links
  2. **`docs/DATA_DOWNLOAD_GUIDE.md`** - Detailed step-by-step instructions

  **You need to download:**
  - 📊 MIT Election Lab data (2016 & 2020) - 2 CSV files
  - 💊 CDC WONDER overdose data (2013-2016 & 2017-2020) - 2 TXT files
  - 🏘️ USDA Rural-Urban Codes (2023) - 1 XLSX file

  ---

  1. **Download the 5 manual files** using the guide:
     ```bash
     cat MANUAL_DOWNLOADS.md
     ```

  2. **Verify all data is ready:**
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     python -c "from pain_politics.data.catalog import DataCatalog; DataCatalog().log_summary()"
     ```
     ```bash
     python scripts/run_pipeline.py build-data
     ```

     This will generate `data/processed/counties_analysis.geojson` with **~3,100 US counties** including:
     - Election results (2016, 2020, 2024)
     - County Health Rankings metrics (2016 & 2024 changes)
     - Overdose mortality rates
     - Rural-urban classifications
     - CDC health indicators
     - Demographics

  ### 📁 Created Files:
  - `scripts/download_data.py` - Automated download script
  - `MANUAL_DOWNLOADS.md` - Quick reference
  - `docs/DATA_DOWNLOAD_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive guide with detailed instructions

  The pipeline is ready to build the full dataset once you complete the manual downloads! 🎉


• Nice work getting the automated downloads in place and lining up the manual assets—those guides make the next steps
  clear. Once you’ve dropped the five manual files into the indicated folders, activate the venv (source .venv/bin/
  activate) and run:

  python scripts/run_pipeline.py build-data

  You’ll get the full data/processed/counties_analysis.geojson by merging everything through the pipeline. If you hit
  anything while fetching the manual data, just point me at it and I’ll help move it along.
